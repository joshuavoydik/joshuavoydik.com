  <h1>Joshua Voydik</h1>
</div>

I’m a technology entrepreneur, previously [Swell](https://swell.is), and now currently working on a new project in AI. I spend much of my time building new tools, training and finetuning [models](https://www.huggingface.co), and [podcasting](https://probablysomethingpod.com) with smart people.   

As an advisor and consultant, I help companies grow revenue with product strategy, partnerships, and GTM motions. Recent work includes partnering with [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering), [Austin Evans](https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans), [Sony](https://www.sony.com/en/), and [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/).
