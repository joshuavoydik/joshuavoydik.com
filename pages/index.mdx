  <h1>Joshua Voydik</h1>

I’m a technology entrepreneur, startup advisor, and growth consultant. I previously co-founded the ecommerce platform [Swell](https://swell.is). Now I help companies develop growth strategies focused on partnerships, business development, and go-to-market execution.

I've brokered strategic partnerships for startups and brands that have reached millions.  Recent work includes partnering with YouTube creators like [Unbox Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/@unboxtherapy), Fortune 500 companies like [Sony](https://www.sony.com/en/), podcasters like [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/), and more. 

I'm also spending much of my time learning about and exploring AI—building new tools, training and finetuning [models](https://www.huggingface.co), and augmenting myself as much as possible.

If you're interested in collaborating, you can book a call with me [here](https://cal.com/joshua).
