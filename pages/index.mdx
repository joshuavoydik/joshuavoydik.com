# Joshua Voydik

Iâ€™m a technology entrepreneur and growth consultant, and I previously co-founded the ecommerce platform [Swell](https://swell.is). I help companies develop growth strategies focused on partnerships, business development, and go-to-market execution.

With over 10 years of experience, I've brokered strategic partnerships for startups/brands that have reached millions.  My recent work includes partnering with YouTube creators like MKBHD, Fortune 500 companies like Sony, podcasters like Tim Ferriss, and more. 

I take a hands-on approach, involved in every aspect of a project from ideation to execution. I'm always pursuing new, exciting challenges. If you're a startup seeking help with growth, let's connect.
